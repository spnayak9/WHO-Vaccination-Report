### Vaccination Report

This project focuses on analyzing global vaccination data to uncover insights into vaccination coverage, disease incidence, and vaccine effectiveness. It integrates data engineering, analytics, and visualization techniques to support public health decision-making.

### Skills Demonstrated

*   Python scripting for data extraction and cleaning
*   SQL for database design and querying
*   Power BI for interactive dashboards
*   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Domain

*   Public Health and Epidemiology

### Problem Statement

The goal is to analyze global vaccination data to:
*   Understand trends in coverage and disease incidence
*   Evaluate vaccine effectiveness
*   Support public health strategies through data-driven insights

### Business Use Cases

*   **Public Health Strategy:** Identify regions with low coverage and assess program effectiveness.
*   **Disease Prevention:** Detect inefficiencies and support booster policies.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Forecast vaccine demand and optimize distribution.
*   **Global Health Policy:** Inform policy decisions with evidence-based insights.

### Approach

1.  **Data Cleaning**
    *   Handle missing values
    *   Normalize units and formats
    *   Ensure date consistency
2.  **Fabric Lakehouse Creation**
    *   Create normalized relational tables (vaccines, diseases, countries, years)
    *   Ensure data integrity with keys and constraints
3.  **Power BI Integration**
    *   Connect Power BI to SQL database
    *   Set up scheduled refreshes
4.  **Data Visualization**
    *   Interactive dashboards with filters and slicers
    *   Key visuals: heatmaps, trend lines, scatter plots, KPIs
5.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    *   Statistical summaries and correlation analysis
    *   Visual insights into coverage, incidence, and disparities

### Key Questions Answered

*   Correlation between vaccination and disease reduction
*   Drop-off rates between doses
*   Gender, education, and urban-rural disparities
*   Booster uptake trends and seasonal patterns
*   Impact of vaccine introduction on disease cases
*   Coverage gaps and regional disparities
*   Antigen-specific effectiveness



### Results

*   Cleaned and structured SQL database
*   Power BI dashboards with actionable insights
*   Analytical findings on vaccination trends and disease control

### Evaluation Metrics

*   Quality of data cleaning and normalization
*   SQL database integrity and structure
*   Clarity and interactivity of Power BI visuals
*   Actionability of insights for public health

### Project Summary

The Vaccination Data Analysis and Visualization project successfully integrates data engineering, analytics, and visualization to address critical public health challenges. By cleaning and structuring global vaccination and disease data into a normalized SQL database, and visualizing it through interactive Power BI dashboards, the project delivers actionable insights into vaccination coverage, disease incidence, and policy effectiveness.

Key outcomes include:
*   Identification of regions with low vaccination coverage
*   Evaluation of vaccine impact on disease reduction
*   Support for strategic resource allocation and policy formulation

This project demonstrates proficiency in Python, SQL, and Power BI, and showcases the ability to transform raw health data into meaningful insights that can guide global health strategies and improve immunization outcomes.
